{
q:`Officers arrest Marcus for burglary and transport him to the station. While booking Marcus, an officer says, “This is a lot easier when people explain themselves.” Marcus responds, “I just needed the money.” No Miranda warnings were given. At trial, the statement is:`,
a:[
"Admissible because it was voluntary",
"Admissible because booking questions do not require Miranda",
"Inadmissible because it was the functional equivalent of interrogation",
"Inadmissible because Marcus had already been arrested"
],
c:2,
e:"Statements made in response to police comments reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response constitute interrogation under Miranda."
},

{
q:`Detectives visit Elena at her home regarding a fraud investigation. They tell her she is not under arrest and is free to ask them to leave. During a 30-minute interview at her kitchen table, Elena admits falsifying records. No Miranda warnings were given. The statement is:`,
a:[
"Inadmissible because she was a suspect",
"Inadmissible because the interview was lengthy",
"Admissible because Elena was not in custody",
"Admissible only if she signed a waiver"
],
c:2,
e:"Miranda applies only to custodial interrogation. A reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter."
},

{
q:`After being arrested for robbery, Kevin states, “I don’t want to talk about this.” Officers immediately stop questioning. Two hours later, a different officer asks Kevin about an unrelated theft without re-Mirandizing him. Kevin confesses. The confession is:`,
a:[
"Admissible because it involved a different crime",
"Inadmissible because Kevin invoked his right to remain silent",
"Admissible because time passed",
"Admissible because a new officer questioned him"
],
c:1,
e:"Once a suspect invokes the right to remain silent, police must scrupulously honor that invocation."
},

{
q:`Police arrest Sarah for drug trafficking. After receiving Miranda warnings, Sarah says, “Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.” Officers continue questioning, and Sarah confesses. The confession is:`,
a:[
"Admissible because Sarah did not clearly request a lawyer",
"Inadmissible because officers must clarify her intent",
"Inadmissible because any reference to a lawyer requires questioning to stop",
"Admissible because the confession was voluntary"
],
c:0,
e:"A suspect must unambiguously invoke the right to counsel. Ambiguous statements do not require police to stop."
},

{
q:`During a custodial interrogation, officers tell Jamal that if he does not confess, his girlfriend will be arrested and his children placed in foster care. Jamal confesses. His confession is:`,
a:[
"Admissible because police may use psychological pressure",
"Inadmissible because the confession was coerced",
"Admissible because the threat was lawful",
"Admissible because Jamal waived his rights"
],
c:1,
e:"Threats involving family members can overbear a suspect’s will and render a statement involuntary."
},

{
q:`After invoking his Miranda rights, Leo is placed in a holding cell. Another inmate, who is secretly an undercover officer, listens as Leo confesses to the crime. At trial, the confession is:`,
a:[
"Inadmissible due to Miranda violation",
"Inadmissible due to Fifth Amendment coercion",
"Admissible because statements to undercover agents are not interrogation",

],
c:2,
e:"Miranda does not apply to statements made voluntarily to undercover officers."
},

{
q:`Officers arrest Tina and read her Miranda warnings. When asked if she understands her rights, Tina says nothing but begins explaining her involvement in the crime. Her statements are:`,
a:[
"Inadmissible without an express verbal waiver",
"Admissible because Tina impliedly waived her rights",
"Inadmissible due to silence",
"Admissible only if recorded"
],
c:1,
e:"A suspect may impliedly waive Miranda rights through voluntary speech after warnings."
},

{
q:`Federal agents subpoena Ryan to testify before a grand jury. Ryan invokes the Fifth Amendment. The government obtains a court order granting use immunity and compels testimony. Which is true?`,
a:[
"Ryan cannot be prosecuted for any crimes discussed",
"The testimony may not be used directly or indirectly against Ryan",
"The immunity only applies to state prosecutions",
"Ryan may still refuse to testify"
],
c:1,
e:"Use immunity prohibits the government from using compelled testimony or its fruits against the witness."
},

{
q:`Police arrest Nina and question her without Miranda warnings. Nina remains silent throughout the interrogation. At trial, prosecutors comment on her silence as evidence of guilt. This is:`,
a:[
"Permissible because no Miranda warnings were given",
"Permissible impeachment evidence",
"Impermissible under the Fifth Amendment",
"Permissible if silence occurred post-arrest"
],
c:2,
e:"The Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from using a defendant’s silence against them."
},

{
q:`Officers arrest Paul and read him Miranda warnings. Paul says, “I know my rights, let’s get this over with.” He then answers questions for 45 minutes. His waiver is:`,
a:[
"Invalid because it was not written",
"Invalid because it was not explicit",
"Valid because it was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent",
"Invalid because the questioning was lengthy"
],
c:2,
e:"Miranda waivers do not need to be written or explicit if the totality shows knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver."
}
